# Find a single IIS of an infeasible problem, using an elastic filtering, followed by a deletion/sensitivity filter.
#
# The performance of this approach varies depending on the problem's properties and the size of the IIS.
# It is clear from a limited test that some problems yield an IIS very fast, and some will take their time.
# This is partly due to the inefficient way this is done by interfacing with a solver through a high level modeler,
# which does not let us access the solver internal states nor do partial solves.
#
# In addition, a more sophisticated implementation should use heuristics to determine which algorithm to use, and when.
# For example, a heuristic could be able to tell us running an elastic filtering step is inefficient based on the
# properties of the problem, leading to a faster result while still maintaining the huge speed-up (I measured up
# to 90x speed improvements for some problems such as `gosh.mps`) of having the elastic filtering pass.
#
# Combining the two, we could imagine being able based on a heuristic be able during the solving that the method
# currently picked will be inefficient, and try something else. If we also pour in the ability to optimize the
# algorithms used, there is a huge potential for improvement over this rather crude implementation.
